About Open Source Society
--------

The OSS is [described]
(http://www.i-programmer.info/news/150-training-a-education/9070-oss-university-a-free-computer-science-degree-curriculum.html)
as:

> an initiative on GitHub to devise a complete curriculum for studying computer science using
> courses from prestigious universities in your own time and for free.

In essence, it is a list of free, open courses provided by universities - [MIT OpenCourseWare]
(http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and the like - which, when studied
sequentially, purports to be broadly equivalent to an undergraduate level computer science education.
